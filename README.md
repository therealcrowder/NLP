# Natural Language Processing (NLP) w/ Python
This was an attempt with Natural Language Processing using a library in Python called Natural Language Toolkit, or NLTK. We used a dataset from Kaggle with Eurpopean hotel data. 

I found the API from Natural Language Tookit [(NLTK)](https://www.nltk.org/) to be very useful for this exercise.
